# Fitoclone (I will think of a better title at a later date!!)

Fitocracy is a website for tracking workouts that uses mechanics from both role-playing video games (obtaining points, levelling up, performing quests, obtaining achievements), and social media sites (status updates, liking/commenting on other people's workouts/posts, joining groups). I have been using the website for a number of years, but over time I have become less and less interested in both the gamification and social aspects of it, and have instead been using it as a straight workout tracker. Unfortunately I feel there are a couple of areas where it falls short in this (it is quite time-confusing to retrieve old workout data, the system for tracking personal records is limited) and basic some functionality (like the ability to save set workout routines/templates) are premium-only features. Furthermore since the site was sold a few years ago, it seems development/maintenance on it is minimal (i.e. the Android app has been deleted from the Google Play store), leading me to believe it won't be around forever.

My intention is to create a simple CRUD app that will serve as a future-proof replacement to Fitocracy for tracking my own workouts, removing the features I don't use and adding features I would find useful. I will also provide the ability to import existing data from Fitocracy.
